(1) Save the data to a CSV file and read into R for analysis. 
(2) Make a histogram of the duration of days of hospital stays.  Use a width of 1 day. 
(3) Find the mean, median, standard deviation, first and third quartiles, minimum and maximum of the durations of hospital stay in the sample.  
- What is the best single number summary of the spread of the distribution? 
 (4) Assume that the literature on this topic suggests that the distribution of days of hospital stay are normally distributed with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 
 3.  Use R to determine the probabilities below based on the normal distribution:
(a) What percentage of patients are in the hospital for less than 10 days? 
(a) What percentage of patients are in the hospital between 3 and 10 days?
