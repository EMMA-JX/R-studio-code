(1) To get a sense of the data, generate a scatterplot to examine
the association between prestige score and years of education.  
(2) Perform a simple linear regression.  
Generate a residual plot. 
Assess whether the model assumptions are met.  Are there any outliers or influence points? 
(3) Calculate the least squares regression equation that predicts prestige from education, income and percentage of women. 
Formally test whether the set of these predictors are associated with prestige at the  = 0.05 level. 

(4) If the overall model was significant, summarize the information about the contribution of 
each variable separately at the same significance level as used for the overall model 

(5) Generate a residual plot showing the fitted values from the regression against the residuals.
